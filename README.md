# Plushible_Toys_STRIPEAPI

## This is a cute shop that is built entirel in typescript for plushible toys.
The back end was built using expressjs and the frontend utilises Reactjs with Material UI elements and componets to add flavor.

To run the application on your local machine:

* clone this repository using ***git clone***
* cd into the backend and run ***npm install*** followed by ***npm start***
* cd into the frontend and run ***npm install*** followed by ***npm start***

## The Plushible shop App ustilizes an MVC pattern
In This case i used the stripe API as by model where i fetched all the toys that were stored in the produts section of stripe.
The controller then asynchronously handles the fetching logic in the backend.
All the main code base is stored in the src folder and the transpiles JS is stored in the dist folder.

In the frontend, prop management is mostly handled using context.
